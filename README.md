 Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not?

- Not really, the messaging feature of a messaging application invovles multiple components interacting, the UI, the user input, user output, etc, unit test is only for small components. 

Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature?
- Yes, it makes a lot more sense to use a unit test here because you can quickly verify if the size is 80 characters or less.
